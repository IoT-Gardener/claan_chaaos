# Claan Caalm
Welcome to season 4 of Claans at Advancing Analytics. This time around things havetaken a step back, but will still keep a dose of D&D flair! This season should feel like a little more leasurly as you prepared for the storm to come... There are a whole host of changes, but fundamentally it is the same: bond with you Claan mates, score points, and fight for a seat in the legendary all-you-claan-eat feast!

## How it works!
Claans and the Claan competition are here as a tool to encourage a healthy work life balance, and to promote practicing self care! Plus it is a great opportunity to socialise and cooperate with others in the company who aren't in your department and project teams
        
### Quests
Each fortnight there will be 5 quests for each member member of the Claan to complete. The reward for each quest will be a dice, ranging from D4 to D10 points. It will be automatically rolled and the result added to your Claan's score.

D4 - D10 Quests can now be completed daily!
The D12 quest will always be a Claan Challenge, it is generally completed as a team and can only completed once per person

### Steps
Step counting is back, and this time it is simple! If you complete 10,000 steps or more in a day, you can log it in the portal and claim yourself D4 points!
        
### Activities
Activities are also back! Each week different activities will be incentivised but by default 45 minutes of indoor exercise will net you D6 points, 45 minutes of outdoor exercise will net you D8 points, and participating in a team sport will net you D10 points!

All activities can be logged daily too!

### The Claan Portal
To make it even easier to contribute to your Claan, track your Claan score, Claan Caalm  will keep the shiny web portal you all love! This can be found at [here](https://claan-chaaos.streamlit.app)! This means you can contribute to your claan from anywhere, any time, even from mobile!

This app will have a home page with an overview of the total scores for each Claan, then a Claan page for your Claan members to see the current set of quests to be completed! In this page, locked behind a top secret password, you can log your quests, see some stats, and also track what your Claan have been up to.
