# Claan ChAAos
Welcome to season 3 of Claans at Advancing Analytics. This time around things have been shaken up and injected with a healthy dose of D&D flair! This season should feel like a mixture of a roller coaster and an adventure. There are a whole host of changes, but fundamentally it is the same: bond with you Claan mates, score points, and fight for a seat in the legendary all-you-claan-eat feast!

### Refreshed Claans
A new season brings fresh Claans. Bid farewell to you current Claan mates and share you final goodbyes in preparation for the grand reshuffling. There will be a Gathering of epic proportions as all names are thrown to the cosmic winds to let the universe decide the members of each Claan. 

You should also get ready to move and decorate! As you will be required to relocate your desk to the zone of your new Claan! This is a good opportunity for a spring clean and to rebrand yourself as the person with the coolest desk. Naturally there will be **Claan Dice** available for the best desk!

### A New Way of Scoring
**Claan Dice**? What are these mystical and magical objects I hear you ask?! Rather than having fixed numbers of points attached to the Claan effort, completeing quests will earn you Claan dice. 

Every fortnight there will be a list of quests published to the Claan portal for all members of the Claan to complete. These will range from the standard step count challenges, to solving Wordles, to spending bonusly points. 

Each time you complete one of these quests you can log it in the portal and earn a dice for you Claan. At the end of the fortnight you will have accumulated a pool of dice equal to the number of quests completed by the Claan.

The Claan will then roll the accumulated dice and convert the results into points! Best prepare your shrine to lady luck and make an offering in Tymora's name.

#### Upgrading the Claan Dice
The base Claan dice will be a D4, but for each different member of the Claan who contributes in a given fortnight the dice will go up one step. 

D4 -> D6 -> D8 -> D10 -> D12 -> D20

In order to maximise you score you will need 6 people in the Claan to complete at least one quest each week, so work as a team to make sure everyone is involved!

### The Claan Portal
To make it even easier to contribute to your Claan, track your dice pool, and see your Claan upgrades Claan Chaaos will come complete with a shiny new web portal! This can be found at [here](https://claan-chaaos.streamlit.app)! This means you can contribute to your claan from anywhere, any time, even from mobile!

This app will have a home page with an overview of the total scores for each Claan, their members, and the current set of quests to be completed! Each Claan will then have their own page, locked behind a top secret password, where they can log their quests, see the number of dice in the current pool, and also track which step their Claan Dice are on. 

### Time Marches On
This season, time waits for no-one! Quests will be up for a fortnight then the window will close and entries for that period of time will no longer be valid. So make sure to keep on top of things and log your quests as you complete them!

Just like this season we will also have Claanpions to help you remember what is going on and keep on top of the quests. This season they might even have *special powers*...

### Wild Magic
To add to the chaos already caused by the Claan shuffle and points being accumulated by rolling dice, season 3 will introduce wild magic!

At certain points throughout the season a roll on the wild magic table might be required, which can be both a blessing and a curse! To roll on the wild magic table simply roll a d100 and consult the table to see chaos is unleashed!

This effects can sometimes be positive or sometimes negative, but the higher the dice roll, the better the effect will likely be!

### Dice as Currency?!
To make Claan Dice even more valuable, they won't just be your primary mechanism for scoring points, they will also be exchangable for powerful claan items. Some of these items will have effects that last for the duration of the season, while others will be "consumable" and have effects that only grant a temporary effect. You can only purchase one magic item per fortnight, so chose wisely! It is also worth noting that you cannot carry dice over, so if you want something expensive, get working on those quests!

### The Tez and Si Effect
This season Terry and Simon will be around to cause even more chaos during company events, they have the power to: grant Claan Dice, increase the dice step of a Claan, and even cause rolls on the Wild Magic table! 

Stay vigilant if they are around!
