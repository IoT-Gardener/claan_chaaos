# Claan ChAAos
Welcome to seasion 3 of Claans at Advancing Analytics. This time around things have been shaken up and injected with a healthy dose of D&D flair! This season should feel like a mixture of a roller coaster and an adventure. There are a whole host of changes, but fundamentally it is the same: bond with you Claan mates, score points, and fight for a seat in the legendary all-you-claan-eat feast!

### Refreshed Claans
A new season brings fresh Claans. Bid farewell to you current Claan mates and share you final goodbyes in preparation for the grand reshuffling. There will be a Gathering of epic proportions as all names are thrown to the cosmic winds to let the universe decide the members of each Claan. 

You should also get ready to move and decorate! As you will be required to relocate your desk to the zone of your new Claan! This is a good opportunity for a spring clean and to rebrand yourself as the person with the coolest desk. Naturally there will be **Claan Dice** available for the best desk!

### A New Way of Scoring
**Claan Dice**? What are these mystical and magical objects I hear you ask?! Rather than having fixed numbers of points attached to the Claan effort, completeing challenges and activites will earn you Claan dice. 

Every fortnight there will be a list of activites and challenges published to the Claan portal for all members of the Claan to complete. These will range from the standard step count challenges, to solving Wordles, to spending bonusly points. 

Each time you complete one of these challenges or activities you can log it in the portal and earn a dice for you Claan. At the end of the fortnight you will have accumulated a pool of dice equal to the number of activities and challenges completed by the Claan.

The Claan will then roll the accumulated dice and convert the results into points! Best prepare your shrine to lady luck and make an offering in Tymora's name.
{{note
##### Upgrading the Claan Dice
The base Claan dice will be a D4, but for each different member of the Claan who contributes in a given fortnight the dice will go up one step. 

D4 -> D6 -> D8 -> D10 -> D12 -> D20

In order to maximise you score you will need 6 people in the Claan to complete at least one challenge or activity each week, so work as a team to make sure everyone is involved!

### The Claan Portal
To make it even easier to contribute to your Claan, track your dice pool, and see your Claan upgrades Claan Chaaos will come complete with a shiny new web portal! This can be found at [here](https://claan-chaaos.streamlit.app)! This means you can contribute to your claan from anywhere, any time, even from mobile!

This app will have a home page with an overview of the total scores for each Claan, their members, and the current set of activities and challenges to be completed! Each Claan will then have their own page, locked behind a top secret password, where they can log their activities, see the number of dice in the current pool, and also track which step their Claan Dice are on. 

### Time Marches On
This season, time waits for no-one! Challenges and activities will be up for a fortnight then the window will close and entries for that period of time will no longer be valid. So make sure to keep on top of things and log your challenges and activities as you complete them!

Just like this season we will also have Claanpions to help you remember what is going on and keep on top of the challenges and activities. This season they might even have *special powers*...

### Wild Magic
To add to the chaos already caused by the Claan shuffle and points being accumulated by rolling dice, season 3 will introduce wild magic!

At certain points throughout the season a roll on the wild magic table might be required, which can be both a blessing and a curse! To roll on the wild magic table simply roll a d100 and consult the table to see chaos is unleashed!

This effects can sometimes be positive or sometimes negative, but the higher the dice roll, the better the effect will likely be!


##### Sample Negative Effects
| Roll | Name | Effect |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 11 - 15 | Distorted Distribution | When scoring at the end of the fortnight, subtract 5 from the roll of the Dice pool. |
| 16 - 20 | Entropy Eclipse | Roll a d6 and subtract the result from your Claan score. |
| 21 - 25 | Dropout Dilemma |  Lose d4 die from your Claan Dice pool. |
| 26 - 30 | Model Misfit | Reduce the step of your Claan Dice pool by 1. |


##### Sample Positive Effects
| Roll | Name | Effect |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 66 - 70 | Precision Surge | Add a d20 to your Claan Dice pool. |
| 71 - 75 | Regression Resurgence | Add d4 dice to your Claan pool. |
| 76 - 80 | Insightful Overflow | Increase the step of your Claan DIce pool by 1. |
| 8 1- 85 | Data Harmony |  When scoring at the end of the fortnight add 5 to the roll of the Dice pool. |
| 86 - 90 | Algorithmic Advantage | Gain an extra dice with a boosted probability distribution for your Claan Dice pool. |

### Dice as Currency?!
To make Claan Dice even more valuable, they won't just be your primary mechanism for scoring points, they will also be exchangable for powerful claan items. Some of these items will have effects that last for the duration of the season, while others will be "consumable" and have effects that only grant a temporary effect.

Below are two of the items that are on offer:

{{descriptive
##### Azure Aegis Shield
**Cost: 6d20**

For the rest of this season dice cannot be removed from your Claan Dice pool, even through the effects of wild magic.
}}
{{descriptive
##### Schema Shifting Elixir
**Cost: 3d8**

Merge your current dice pool with that of another Claan of your choice. Taking half the dice at random for each Claan.
}}

Some of the items will require dice which are a number of steps above the base, which means if you Claan decide they want to buy them then a team effort will be required to increase the steps of the dice enough to become useable currency for the item. Buying an item that costs d20s means 6 Claan members will need to contribute.

### The Tez and Si Effect
This season Terry and Simon will be around to cause even more chaos during company events, they have the power to: grant Claan Dice, increase the dice step of a Claan, and even cause rolls on the Wild Magic table!

Stay vigilant if they are around!
